<H3>What is Periodic Calendar?</H3>
Periodic Calendar is a GUI utility which can be used to:
<ul>
	<li>track women menstrual cycles</li>
	<li>predict the fertile days when the probability to get pregnant is high</li>
	<li>predict the "safe" days when the probability to get pregnant is minimal</li>
	<li>predict the day of the next menstruations</li>
	<li>record the pregnancy</li>
	<li>calculate the pregnancy weeks</li>
	<li>predict the baby's birth date</li>
	<li>record the personal notes for any day</li>
</ul>

<p>Periodic Calendar provides support for sympto-thermal method which has the highest
reliability in fertility periods prediction. User can choose any subset of the 
features to be used or even fall to the generic calendar method (which if used 
alone is very unreliable).</p>

<p>Authors of the Periodic Calendar still insist on not being an equal substitute
to the fertility planning consultants or doctors. Before using this application
please talk to your doctor or read a good book on the subject.</p>
