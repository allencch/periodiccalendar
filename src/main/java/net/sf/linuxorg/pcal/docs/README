Periodic Calendar is a GUI application which assists in women menstrual cycles
tracking and fertility periods prediction. This information can be used as 
supportive either for conception or contraception planning.

Periodic Calendar provides support for sympto-thermal method which has the highest
reliability in fertility periods prediction. User can choose any subset of the 
features to be used or even fall to the generic calendar method (which if used 
alone is very unreliable).  

Authors of the Periodic Calendar still insist on not being an equal substitute
to the fertility planning consultants or doctors. Before using this application
please talk to your doctor or read a good book on the subject.

THIS PROGRAM PREDICTIONS IN NO WAY CAN BE USED AS THE FINAL. THERE ARE NO 
PREDICTION METHODS WHICH PROVIDE 100% RELIABILITY.

Please see the application online help for more information.
