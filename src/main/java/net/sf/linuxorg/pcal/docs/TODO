General project To Do list.

1. Merge main window with the self-observation dashboard. Allow the user to choose what should be visible on the screen. 
Allow dragging out panels from the main window and rearranging them per user discretion. Is that possible in SWING? 
2. Add the possibility to drag and drop events in the calendar to other date. This is more logical than Delete->Create sequence.
3. Associate different icons with the dates. This will bring "Date Types" idea into the application.
4. Create report dialog to provide statistical information about the number of the "date types" per specified period.
5. Replace Statistics graph with barchart with connected tops. This will reflect better the nature of the graph.
